# How is your today?

I released an iOS app named “Today - Score Everyday”.

What you do in this app is to input the score of “Today” at the end of the day.

That’s all.

I got the inspiration when I read “Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All”.

> Simply take the time to ask yourself each day. “When was I at my best?” or “When was work most rewarding?” It can help point you toward roles or activities that will enrich your work and reveal what gives you the greatest pleasure or fulfillment.

I want to know when I was at my best or what makes me happy in everyday life.

And I’m a developer, so I decided to create an app.

Since Today is an open source project, if you have a good idea, please contribute and submit a pull request.
